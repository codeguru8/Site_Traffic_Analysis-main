### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are numbers of sessions?
- What are  numbers of engaged session?
- What are our revenue? 
- How many users visited the website?

1. The Total users were 6,143.
2. The numbers of sessions were 6,245.

- Focus on expanding in the city of Tucson.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.
- The city of Tucson should be more targeted city for more users.
  

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. And also hide unused coloumn.
